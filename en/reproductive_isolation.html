As shown on Fig.&nbsp;1, these four species have everything it takes to <strong>hybridize a lot</strong>:
<ul style="font-size: large">
  <li><strong>Phylogenetic proximity:</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Sympatry:</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Synchronous flowering:</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Compatible floral morphologies:</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
So, why are these 4 species so interesting? In fact, they have everything it takes to hybridize a lot:
+ they are very close in the phylogeny,
+ they live sympatrically in Argentina and Bolivia,
+ they flower at the same time 
+ and they have very similar floral morphologies, which makes it anatomically possible for these 4 species to hybridize and make strong, fertile hybrids.
+ However, in nature, hybridization remains a very limited phenomenon between these species. So the question is: Why? How does it work?
</p>
<p>
We suggest that the key of the mystery lies in the pistil. To prove this, we made a very simple experiment.
+ We took a pistil from the blue species and we pollinated it
+ with a 50-50 mix of pollen from the blue and the red species, which is the closest one in the phylogeny.
+ Normally, we would expect a 50-50 progeny, with 50% blue by blue “pure” individuals and 50% red by blue hybrids.
+ In fact, we got was only 8% hybrids.
This means that something is going on in the pistil to favor conspecific pollen tubes.
</p>
<p>
Let’s have a closer look at pollen-pistil interactions.
+ Between pollination and fertilization, pistil and pollen tubes go through a coordinated series of cellular interactions, all of which are finely controlled by molecular cues exchanged between the two partners.
+ In <em>Solanum</em> species, the whole process takes 36 h. According to the results I’ve just presented, at least one of these interactions must be species-specific.
+ To go further, we chose to focus on pollen tube guidance to ovules. Not only because it is one of the most elegant and exciting sexual interactions in plants,
+ but also because it was shown to be species-specific in three other plant taxa: Torenia, Arabidopsis and maize.
