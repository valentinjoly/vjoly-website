In fact, they have everything it takes to hybridize a lot: + they are very close in the phylogeny, + they live sympatrically in Argentina and Bolivia, + they flower at the same time + and they have very similar floral morphologies, which makes it anatomically possible for these 4 species to hybridize and make strong, fertile hybrids. + However, in nature, hybridization remains a very limited phenomenon between these species. So the question is: Why? How does it work? </p> <p> We suggest that the key of the mystery lies in the pistil. To prove this, we made a very simple experiment. + We took a pistil from the blue species and we pollinated it + with a 50-50 mix of pollen from the blue and the red species, which is the closest one in the phylogeny. + Normally, we would expect a 50-50 progeny, with 50% blue by blue “pure” individuals and 50% red by blue hybrids. + In fact, we got was only 8% hybrids. This means that something is going on in the pistil to favor conspecific pollen tubes. </p> <p> Let’s have a closer look at pollen-pistil interactions. + Between pollination and fertilization, pistil and pollen tubes go through a coordinated series of cellular interactions, all of which are finely controlled by molecular cues exchanged between the two partners. + In <em>Solanum</em> species, the whole process takes 36 h. According to the results I’ve just presented, at least one of these interactions must be species-specific. + To go further, we chose to focus on pollen tube guidance to ovules. Not only because it is one of the most elegant and exciting sexual interactions in plants, + but also because it was shown to be species-specific in three other plant taxa: Torenia, Arabidopsis and maize. </p><div class="row"> <div class="col-12"> <center><a href="wild_potatoes.html" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" role="button"> <span class="fas fa-angle-left"></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Prev </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="pt_guidance.html" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" role="button"> Next&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="fas fa-angle-right"></span> </a></center> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
