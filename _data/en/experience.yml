  description: "The JSPS summer program is highly selective (10 Canadian students selected) and comes with a ¥534,000 stipend and a ¥158,500 research grant. This experience allowed me to be welcomed for a two-month stay at Prof. Higashiyama's laboratory, and benefit from their expertise to optimize a series of pollen tube guidance microfluidic devices tailored for solanaceous species. These devices allow to monitor both long- and short-distance pollen tube attraction."
