  description: "After the release of the KAPPA CRP detection program, I got involved in a project developed at Dr. Edqvist's laboratory aiming to study the evolution and diversification of the non-specific lipid-transfer proteins (nsLTPs) across plant taxa. This stay in his lab allowed us to launch this collaboration, which is still active."

- name: JSPS Summer Program
  field: Pollen tube microfluidics
  date: June–Aug. 2016
  supervisor: Prof. Tetsuya Higashiyama
  institution: Institute for Transformative Bio-Molecules (ITbM), Nagoya University
  location: Nagoya, Japan

  description: "The JSPS summer program is highly selective (10 Canadian students selected) and comes with a ¥534,000 stipend and a ¥158,500 research grant. This experience allowed me to be welcomed for a two-month stay at Prof. Higashiyama's laboratory, and benefit from their expertise to optimize a series of pollen tube guidance microfluidic devices tailored for solanaceous species. These devices allow to monitor both long- and short-distance pollen tube attraction."
