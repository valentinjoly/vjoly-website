So, how does pollen tube guidance work?
+ When it reaches the ovary, the pollen tube starts to be in the vicinity of an ovule. It now has to find its way to a tiny, hidden entry point – the micropyle – as you can see on these SEM pictures.
+ In Torenia and Arabidopsis, this very precise directional growth was shown to be guided by a gradient of chemoattractant proteins, the LURE peptides, secreted around the micropyle. This is a short distance attraction.
</p>
<p>
We know that such a short distance guidance exists in our <em>Solanum</em> species.
+ Here, you can see pollen tubes exiting the transmitting tissue and entering each ovule through the micropyle.
+ Our lab has obtained an embryo-sac less mutant, frk1, which is defective in short-distance guidance. As you can see here, pollen tubes reach the ovule, but they are wandering around and they can’t find their way to the micropyle.
+ Our question is then: is there a <em>Solanum</em> LURE too?
</p>
<p>
However, on top of short distance guidance, wild potatoes also exhibit a long-distance guidance, which is much slower.
+ On this picture, we see semi-in vivo grown pollen tubes exiting the pistil and scattering on the gel
+ with an average deviation angle of zero.
+ However, if we place a cluster of ovules 700 µm away from the style end, with a 45° angle, 
+ we observe a clear, long-distance attraction of pollen tubes, which takes several hours to be achieved.
+ We are then looking for a long-distance attractant too.
</p>
<p>
Long-distance guidance occurs when you take blue pollen tubes vs. blue ovules. But what happens in an interspecific context?
+ If you keep blue ovules but turn to use red pollen tubes, guidance is still operating, probably because the red species is a very close relative.
+ However, if you switch to pollen tubes from the green or the yellow species, guidance is abolished, which means that long-distance guidance is a species-specificity checkpoint
</p>
<p>
Molecularly speaking, we may suggest this simple model of an ovule attractant detected by a compatible, species-specific pollen receptor. However, the binding site of these interactants can change quickly in the course of evolution, as you can see here for the + green and + yellow species. 
+ So in case of an interspecific cross, the green and the yellow receptors are not able to perfectly bind the ovule attractant.
</p>
<p>
So we are looking for highly divergent proteins. The problem is now to find them!
