  abstract: "Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves intimate contact and continuous interactions between the growing pollen tube and the female reproductive structures. These interactions can affect gynoecia gene expression well ahead of fertilization. Genes modulated from a distance in the ovary represent one class of such genes. But how precisely can the ovary interprets pollination from a distance in preparation for fertilization? To address this question, transcriptomic analyses were performed on <em>Solanum chacoense</em> ovaries following compatible, incompatible, and heterospecific pollinations, as well as from wounding and touch treatments. In all pollination types, early detection of pollen tubes was perceived as a wounding aggression. As the pollen tubes grew along the style, more and more genes became specific for each pollination type, producing a specific transcriptomic signature. Interestingly, conspecific pollination was marked with regulation of genes related to GA-, ROS-, calcium-, and secondary metabolite-mediated signaling, as well as cell cycle and gene expression, while incompatible pollination remained more akin to a wound response. Our analysis reveals that these pollination types are specifically recognized in the style, and relay this information from a distance to the ovary ahead of fertilization. Similarly to plant–pathogen recognition, it is proposed that every pollen–pistil interaction produces pollen-associated molecular signatures generating diversified and specific responses that convey the current plant pollination status to the ovule in preparation for fertilization."

  abstract: "From the stigma to the ovary, small secreted proteins play pivotal roles in pollen-pistil interactions. They ensure proper pollen tube (PT) growth (germination, elongation, and guidance) and contribute to the establishment of breeding barriers through species-specific interactions. Among them, ovule-secreted proteins (OSPs) were shown to be of particular interest since they control the very last and most critical steps of pollen-pistil interactions such as PT chemoattraction and reception. So far, selection of candidate genes for pollen-ovule interactions has mostly relied on transcriptomics, especially by comparing RNA expression levels between sexually functional and non-functional ovules, or by single cell type analyses. Yet, these approaches do not take into account potential post-transcriptional regulation steps, such as the control of translation initiation, protein storage and secretion. To address this issue, we first developed a new tissue-free gravity-extraction method (tf-GEM) to collect ovule proteinaceous exudates from the wild potato species <em>Solanum chacoense</em>. This, combined with RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based proteomics led to the identification of 305 OSPs, of which more than half were classified as ovule-specific. Functional annotation showed that these OSPs are predicted to control a broad range of reproductive functions, in particular PT growth and guidance —with several cysteine-rich peptides, a GABA-transaminase, and a PELPIII-like protein— as well as late-acting self-incompatibility S-RNase. Moreover, label-free protein quantification revealed that, from the transition of slightly immature ovules 2 days before anthesis to mature ovules, during which the capacity to attract PTs is acquired, 106 OSPs exhibited a highly significant increase in secretion levels (+14-fold on average) without being regulated at the mRNA level, emphasizing the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of reproductive proteins."

  abstract: "Small, secreted cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) are known to control key aspects of sexual plant reproduction such as sporophytic self-incompatibility (SCR/SP11), pollen-style interactions (SCA/LTP5, LeSTIG1), as well as pollen tube guidance (TfLUREs, AtLUREs) and reception (EC1, ZmES4) by the female gametophyte. CRPs have a dual sequence structure, involving (i) a highly conserved cysteine spacing pattern –even between distant species– to maintain the disulfide bonds configuration, and (ii) inter-cysteine blocks that can diverge to a large extent. CRPs can thus exhibit a fast evolutive speed while conserving their 3D structure to maintain their function, which explain why several sexual CRPs such as LUREs exhibit a strong species-specificity. Due to this rapid evolution, detection of orthologs and paralogs of already known CRPs with common bioinformatics software has been laborious up to now. In addition, the cysteine backbone itself can evolve and give rise to totally new families of CRPs, but no tool was available so far to detect and cluster CRPs de novo, without relying on a set of reference proteins. KAPPA fills this gap, providing a simple algorithm specifically dedicated to CRPs and other proteins defined by a ‘key aminoacid’. KAPPA precisely and efficiently assesses the similarity of two CRPs using a new quantitative index called <em>κ</em>-score, and utilizes this value as a criterion to detect all CRPs similar to a seed reference, or to build de novo groups of similar CRPs thanks to an ad hoc recursive clustering function. Application of KAPPA to detection and clustering of well-known CRPs such as defensins or lipid-transfer proteins clearly demonstrated its superiority over classical sequence search methods. Its use on proteomic data available from model organisms will then benefit not only sexual plant reproduction research, but also various areas involving CRPs such as medicine (innate immunity), agronomy (resistance to pathogens), and toxicology (snake venoms)."

  abstract: "Next-generation sequencing technologies challenge researchers with increasing amounts of data. ‘Big data’ itself becomes a biological issue! For instance, transcriptomics and proteomics now make it easy to describe the compendium of proteins expressed in a given cell or tissue. Bioinformatic tools such as the well-known programs BLAST and HMMER have become indispensable to select sequences relevant to a give n research project. However, peculiar classes of proteins still remain very difficult to grasp with these ‘classical’ algorithms. Cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) are part of them. They are involved in highly specific recognition functions in humans, animals and plants, and can thus exhibit a fast evolutive speed while conserving their 3D structure to maintain their function. This is why CRPs have a dual sequence structure: the cysteine spacing pattern is highly conserved – even between distant species – to ma intain the disulfide bonds configuration, while other aminoacids can diverge to a large extent. Consequently, sequence identity can be as low as 15% within a given family of CRPs. Detection of orthologs and paralogs of already known CRPs with common bioinf ormatics software has thus been laborious up to now. In addition, the cysteine backbone itself can evolve and give rise to totally new families of CRPs, but no tool was available so far to detect and cluster CRPs de novo, without relying on a set of refere nce proteins. KAPPA fills this gap, providing a simple algorithm specifically dedicated to CRPs and other proteins defined by a ‘key aminoacid’. KAPPA precisely and efficiently assesses the similarity of two CRPs using a new quantitative index called <em>κ</em>-score. This value is computed taking into account various aspects of cysteine spacing consistency (identity and coverage of inter-cysteine blocks, conservation of cysteines themselves) adjusted by means of user-defined stringency parameters. KAPPA then utili zes the <em>κ</em>-score as a criterion to detect all CRPs similar to a seed reference, or to build de novo groups of similar CRPs thanks to an ad hoc recursive clustering function. Application of KAPPA to detection and clustering of well-known CRPs such as defens ins or lipid-transfer proteins clearly demonstrated its superiority over classical sequence search methods. Its use on proteomic data available from model organisms will then benefit various research areas involving CRPs: e.g. medicine (innate immunity), a gronomy (resistance to pathogens), toxicology (snake venoms), or molecular biology (signaling molecules)."

  abstract: "Wild potatoes (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>Petota</em>) gather dozens of species distributed throughout all Latin America. They share three interesting features: (i) their populations coexist in vast sympatric areas; (ii) their flowering period overlap; and (iii) most of them are physiologically able to hybridize with closely related species. Logically, hybrids should be abundant in nature. Yet, floristic inventories done in Argentina and mixed pollination assays carried out in our greenhouses show that hybridization rates are lower than expected. Why? We hypothesize that species-specificity mechanisms act at the molecular level to favor fertilization of ovules by conspecific pollen to the detriment of heterospecific one. These mechanisms would rely on male-female protein pairs, whose correct interaction – depending on the phylogenetic proximity between both sexual partners – determines reproductive success. Such mechanisms would include numerous checkpoints along the pollen tube growth path. For example, our data show that pollen tubes grow more slowly in heterospecific styles. Further down the path, pollen tubes are also less attracted by heterospecific ovules. Thus pollen tube growth optimization and guidance are crucial for reproductive success. If such phenomenon were confirmed, we would not only better understand the molecular control of sexual reproduction, but also decipher the genetic events underlying speciation of wild potatoes. Using next-generation sequencing technologies we sequenced the ovule transcriptome from three closely related species (<em>Solanum chacoense</em>, <em>Solanum tarijense</em> and <em>Solanum gandarillasii</em>), and are now isolating candidate genes using a broad range of bioinformatic tools. In a first approach, we have chosen to analyze small, secreted peptides, especially the cysteine-rich proteins family (CRPs) that has already been shown to control multiple aspects of pollen-pistil interactions. Using Hidden Markov Models-based sequence search and an original de novo CRP-finding algorithm, we have already detected several clusters of interspecifically divergent proteins with conserved cysteine backbones. By means of differential gene expression analyses between wild type and embryo sac-less mutants, we aim at isolating proteins specifically expressed in the female gametophyte. The same analysis is also being applied to the pollen tube transcriptome from the same species. Once candidate genes are isolated, functional analyses through transgenesis will be performed to determine their role in plant reproduction."
