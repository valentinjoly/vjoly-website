  abstract: "Small, secreted cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) combine a highly stable cysteine spacing, ensuring conservation of their 3D structure and function, and hypervariable inter-cysteine blocks, allowing quick evolution of specific recognition domains. Interestingly, several CRPs were shown to control key pollen-pistil interactions in a species-specific way. The most emblematic example is perhaps the LURE defensin-like family, controlling directional guidance of pollen tubes (PTs) in <em>Torenia</em> and <em>Arabidopsis</em>. We chose wild potatoes (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>Petota</em>) as a case study to investigate the impact of rapid CRP divergence in plant speciation. Gathering ~200 close species with overlapping distribution areas, this taxon indeed exhibits strong reproductive isolation. Lab-on-a-chip microfluidic experiments carried out on 4 species show that species-preferential PT attraction is a key factor in this isolation. We suspect polymorphic CRPs to control this attraction. High-throughput sequencing technologies were applied to profile the ovule secretome as well as the reproductive transcriptomes of our 4 species of interest. To screen out candidate genes, we developped KAPPA, a sequence search algorithm specifically dedicated to CRPs, and obtained a set of 32 defensin-like groups expressed in ovules. Five promising chemoattractant candidates exhibiting (i) ovule-specific expression, (ii) down-regulation in guidance-defective ovules, and (iii) interspecific divergence were selected for further characterization. They are currently being investigated with on-gel assays and specific microfluidic devices tailored for <em>Solanum</em> PTs. This study will lead to a better understanding of CRP-mediated PT chemoattraction as one of the major species-specificity checkpoints that must be “unlocked” by pollen tubes in the pistil."

Interestingly, several CRPs were shown to control key pollen-pistil interactions, including self-incompatibility (SCR/SP11, PrsS), pollen-style interactions (SCA/LTP5, LeSTIG1), sperm discharge (ZmES4), and gamete fusion (EC1). The most emblematic example of species-specific CRP function in reproduction remains however the LURE family, controlling directional guidance of pollen tubes (PTs) in <em>Torenia</em> and <em>Arabidopsis</em>. We chose wild potatoes (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>Petota</em>) as a case study to investigate the impact of rapid CRP divergence in plant speciation.

Lab-on-a-chip microfluidic experiments carried out on 4 species show that species-preferential PT attraction is a key factor in this isolation. We suspect polymorphic CRPs to control this attraction. Next-generation RNA sequencing led us to obtain a set of 33,852 CDS-containing transcripts expressed in ovules. Moreover, an original secretomic approach allowed to directly identify 305 proteins in ovule exudates. To screen out candidate genes, we developped KAPPA, a sequence search algorithm specifically dedicated to CRPs, and obtained a set of 27 CRP families, including defensin-, LTP-, ECA1- and thionin- like proteins, but also groups with new cysteine patterns. Candidate chemoattractant CRPs are currently being investigated with on-gel and microfluidic pollen tube attraction assays, based on a combination of three major features of interest: (i) ovule-specific expression; (ii) down-regulation in guidance-defective (immature and embryo sac-less) ovules); (iii) interspecific divergence, as verified by finding their orthologs in close species and detecting signatures of positive selection such as accumulation of non-synonymous mutations (dN/dS > 1). The current study will lead to a better understanding of CRP-mediated PT chemoattraction as one of the major species-specificity checkpoints that must be “unlocked” by pollen tubes in the pistil."

  abstract: "Gathering 196 species, wild potatoes (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>Petota</em>) are a striking example of plant diversification. Although they coexist sympatrically throughout all Latin America, and have the physiological ability to hybridize with close species, they display strong reproductive isolation barriers. Experiments carried out in our laboratory show that pollen-pistil interactions are the cornerstone of this isolation: in a heterospecific pistil, pollen tubes can be slowed down and/or their receptivity to female chemoattractive cues can be impaired. How is this so finely regulated? Most of plant sexual interactions described to date involve binding of pollinic receptors to female protein ligands expressed in various locations all along the pollen tube path in the pistil or vice versa. We hypothesize that rapid divergence of these reproductive proteins, driven by directional selective pressures, is the engine of interspecific isolation. This could especially take the form of species-specific aminoacid changes accumulating within binding sites, thus impairing mutual recognition in case of an interspecific cross. To identify candidate proteins, we used next-generation sequencing technologies to obtain transcriptomes from ovules, pistils and pollen tubes of four closely related <em>Solanum</em> species species, and screened for coding sequences displaying a non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) greater than the synonymous one (dS), which is a commonly used, robust signature of directional selection. This approach, that had scarcely been applied to plants so far, led to us to identify a wide range of candidates including proteins similar to well-known key players of pollen-pistil interactions —such as the ovule-expressed FERONIA (FER) receptor kinase and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein LORELEI (LRE), stylar adhesion proteins or pollen tube calcium channels— but also totally uncharacterized proteins including several families of small secreted cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs). CRPs are of outstanding interest since they display a dual evolutive pattern, involving a highly conserved cysteine backbone delimitating blocks of extensively divergent aminoacids. Several CRPs were shown to control various aspects of pollen-pistil interactions in other species, especially stigmatic and ovular chemoattraction cues. Using KAPPA, a sequence search program we recently developed to detect these peculiar proteins, we identified new groups of Solanaceous-specific CRPs undergoing rapid divergence between species. These are promising candidates as ligands of pollinic or style receptors. Our study points out that reproductive isolation relies on a coordinated set of pistil species-specific checkpoints that need to be successively “unlocked” by pollen tubes to achieve fertilization. Further functional characterization of these proteins paves the way to a better understanding of the speciation processes in action among wild potatoes."

  abstract: "L’isolement reproductif des 196 espèces de pommes de terre sauvages d’Amérique latine (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>Petota</em>) est une énigme. En effet, malgré la faiblesse apparente des barrières pré- et post-zygotiques à l'hybridation, les espèces « pures » sont largement dominantes en nature, les hybrides restant rares. Comment résoudre ce paradoxe ? La clé du problème pourrait résider entre le moment de la pollinisation et la fécondation. Nous supposons que la communication entre le pistil (femelle) et le tube pollinique (mâle) serait plus efficace lorsque les deux partenaires sont de même espèce. Cette communication repose sur l’interaction de couples de protéines mâle-femelle, dont la divergence interspécifique serait un moteur important de l’isolement reproductif : plus les partenaires sexuels appartiennent à des espèces proches, meilleure sera l’interaction de leurs protéines reproductives. Notre intérêt porte principalement sur les protéines riches en cystéines (CRP), connues pour contrôler à différents niveaux les communications pollen-pistil. Nous avons développé un outil informatique, KAPPA, qui nous permet de détecter les CRP divergentes dans le transcriptome des tissus reproducteurs de <em>Solanum chacoense</em> et de trois espèces proches. Une fois les protéines candidates identifiées, nous aurons recours à la biologie moléculaire pour en caractériser la structure, la fonction et les interactions."

  abstract: "Wild potatoes (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>Petota</em>) gather dozens of species distributed throughout all Latin America. They share three interesting features: (i) their populations coexist in vast sympatric areas; (ii) their flowering period overlap; and (iii) most of them are physiologically able to hybridize with closely related species. Logically, hybrids should be abundant in nature. Yet, floristic inventories done in Argentina and mixed pollination assays carried out in our greenhouses show that hybridization rates are lower than expected. Why? We hypothesize that species-specificity mechanisms act at the molecular level to favour fertilization of ovules by conspecific pollen to the detriment of heterospecific one. These mechanisms would rely on male-female protein pairs, whose correct interaction – depending on the phylogenetic proximity between both sexual partners – determines reproductive success. One such example is the control of pollen tube guidance and attraction. If this phenomenon is confirmed, we would not only better understand the molecular control of sexual reproduction, but also decipher the genetic events underlying speciation of wild potatoes. Using next-generation sequencing technologies we sequenced the ovule transcriptome from three closely related species (<em>Solanum chacoense</em>, <em>S. tarijense</em> and <em>S. gandarillasii</em>), and are now isolating candidate genes using a broad range of bioinformatic tools. The same analysis will also be applied to the pollen transcriptome from the same species. Once candidate genes are isolated, functional analyses through transgenesis will be performed to determine their role in plant reproduction. Here we will analyse the cysteine-rich proteins family (CRPs) that has already been shown to control multiple aspects of pollen-pistil interactions."
