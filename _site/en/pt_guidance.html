It now has to find its way to a tiny, hidden entry point – the micropyle – as you can see on these SEM pictures. + In Torenia and Arabidopsis, this very precise directional growth was shown to be guided by a gradient of chemoattractant proteins, the LURE peptides, secreted around the micropyle. This is a short distance attraction. </p> <p> We know that such a short distance guidance exists in our <em>Solanum</em> species. + Here, you can see pollen tubes exiting the transmitting tissue and entering each ovule through the micropyle. + Our lab has obtained an embryo-sac less mutant, frk1, which is defective in short-distance guidance. As you can see here, pollen tubes reach the ovule, but they are wandering around and they can’t find their way to the micropyle. + Our question is then: is there a <em>Solanum</em> LURE too? </p> <p> However, on top of short distance guidance, wild potatoes also exhibit a long-distance guidance, which is much slower. + On this picture, we see semi-in vivo grown pollen tubes exiting the pistil and scattering on the gel + with an average deviation angle of zero. + However, if we place a cluster of ovules 700 µm away from the style end, with a 45° angle, + we observe a clear, long-distance attraction of pollen tubes, which takes several hours to be achieved. + We are then looking for a long-distance attractant too. </p> <p> Long-distance guidance occurs when you take blue pollen tubes vs. blue ovules. But what happens in an interspecific context? + If you keep blue ovules but turn to use red pollen tubes, guidance is still operating, probably because the red species is a very close relative. + However, if you switch to pollen tubes from the green or the yellow species, guidance is abolished, which means that long-distance guidance is a species-specificity checkpoint </p> <p> Molecularly speaking, we may suggest this simple model of an ovule attractant detected by a compatible, species-specific pollen receptor. However, the binding site of these interactants can change quickly in the course of evolution, as you can see here for the + green and + yellow species. + So in case of an interspecific cross, the green and the yellow receptors are not able to perfectly bind the ovule attractant. </p> <p> So we are looking for highly divergent proteins. The problem is now to find them! </p><div class="row"> <div class="col-12"> <center><a href="reproductive_isolation.html" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" role="button"> <span class="fas fa-angle-left"></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Prev </a></center> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
